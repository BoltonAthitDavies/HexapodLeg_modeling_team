# Frequency Synchronization Fix

## Problem
The commanded positions and actual positions were being published at different rates:
- **Actual positions** (`/joint_states`): 200 Hz (from controller_manager)
- **Commanded positions**: 100 Hz (from position commander nodes)

This caused misalignment in PlotJuggler and made it difficult to compare trajectories accurately.

## Solution
Synchronized all publishing rates to **200 Hz** to match the controller_manager update rate.

## Changes Made

### 1. `pd_position_commander.py`
**Before:**
```python
self.declare_parameter('update_rate', 100.0)
```

**After:**
```python
self.declare_parameter('update_rate', 200.0)  # Match controller_manager rate
```

### 2. `joint_position_commander.py`
**Before:**
```python
self.dt = 0.01  # 100 Hz
```

**After:**
```python
self.dt = 0.005  # 200 Hz (matched with controller_manager)
```

### 3. `spawn_robot_pd.launch.py`
**Before:**
```python
"update_rate": 100.0,
```

**After:**
```python
"update_rate": 200.0,  # Match controller_manager rate for synchronized plotting
```

## Publishing Rates Summary

Now everything runs at **200 Hz** synchronized:

| Topic | Frequency | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `/joint_states` | 200 Hz | controller_manager |
| `/joint_position_controller/commands` | 200 Hz | pd_position_commander |
| `/joint_reference` | 200 Hz | pd_position_commander |

## Benefits

âœ… **Perfect time alignment** in PlotJuggler
âœ… **Smoother visualization** with more data points per second
âœ… **Accurate comparison** between commanded and actual positions
âœ… **No phase lag** between signals
âœ… **Better control performance** with faster command updates

## Test It

```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch hexapod_gz spawn_robot_pd.launch.py
```

In PlotJuggler, you'll now see:
- Both commanded and actual positions updating at the same 200 Hz rate
- Perfect time synchronization between all signals
- Smooth, aligned trajectories for easy comparison

## Technical Details

The `controller_manager` update rate (200 Hz) determines how often:
1. Joint states are read from Gazebo
2. Controllers compute new outputs
3. `/joint_states` topic is published

By matching the command publishing rate to 200 Hz, we ensure:
- Commands arrive at the same rate as the controller updates
- No unnecessary interpolation or waiting
- Optimal control loop performance
- Synchronized data for analysis and visualization

**Time step:** `dt = 1/200 = 0.005 seconds = 5 milliseconds`

This is now consistent across all nodes! ðŸŽ¯
